Hi -- I'm seeking some help with this code. Its the first stage of a Python for Everyone data visualisation project.
I can't work out why the loop stops working during the SQL commands at the end.
I've tested it segment by segment and the loop works fine if you comment out lines 89-90.
Any advice will be most gratefully received!
