Hi -- I'm seeking some help with this omload2.py code. Its the first stage of a Python for Everyone data visualisation project.
I can't work out why the loop stops working during the SQL commands at the end.
I've tested it segment by segment and the loop works fine if you comment out lthe last mysql commands, but it stops working after 
adding one successful row when you leave them in.

Any advice will be most gratefully received!
I know I can probably be doing things more efficiently, but I'll work on that next.... still, any structural advice will be welcome too.
